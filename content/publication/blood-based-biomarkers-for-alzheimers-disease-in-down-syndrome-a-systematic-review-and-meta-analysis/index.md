abstract: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of Alzheimer's
  disease (AD), displaying AD pathology similar to the general population. This
  study evaluated AD-related blood biomarkers in DS within the AT(N) framework
  through a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between
  2017 and October 2024. The meta-analysis focused on plasma amyloid beta
  (Aβ)42, Aβ40, total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, neurofilament
  light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels,
  comparing 2109 DS individuals and 1006 euploid controls. Plasma Aβ42, Aβ40,
  NfL, and GFAP levels were significantly elevated in DS compared to euploid
  controls, while the Aβ42/40 ratio was reduced. In DS-AD individuals, Aβ42 and
  t-tau levels were elevated, with p-tau181, NfL, and GFAP consistently high
  across clinical subgroups. Notably, Aβ40 and the Aβ42/40 ratio changed
  significantly in preclinical AD, while t-tau increased in clinical AD.
  Incorporating inflammation (I) markers highlights neuroinflammation's role in
  DS-AD progression, supporting the blood-based AT(N)I framework for early AD
  detection and monitoring in DS.
