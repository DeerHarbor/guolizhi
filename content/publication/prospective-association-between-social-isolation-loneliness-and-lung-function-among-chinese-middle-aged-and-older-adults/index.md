  Abstract

  Objective

  Previous research has highlighted a heightened occurrence of social isolation and loneliness in older adults diagnosed with chronic lung diseases. Nevertheless, there exists a dearth of studies that have explored the influence of impoverished social relationships on lung function. This study aimed to examine the longitudinal association between social isolation, loneliness and lung function over 4 years among middle-aged and older Chinese adults.


  Methods

  This study employed two waves (2011 and 2015) of data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The analysis was limited to participants aged 45 years and above and stratified based on gender (3325 men and 3794 women). The measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) served as an indicator for assessing lung function. Lagged dependent variable regression models, accounting for covariates, were employed to explore the relationship between baseline social isolation and loneliness and the subsequent PEF.


  Results

  For women, social isolation was significantly associated with the decline in PEF at follow-up (β = −.06, p < .001) even after adjusting for all covariates; no significant correlation was observed between loneliness and PEF. Among men, there was no significant association found between either social isolation or loneliness and PEF.


  Conclusions

  Social isolation is prospectively associated with worse lung function in middle-aged and older Chinese women but not men. The results highlight the importance of promoting social relationships in public health initiatives, especially in groups that are more vulnerable.
