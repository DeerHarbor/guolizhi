# Social Isolation and Loneliness

* **Social isolation** is the objective absence of social contact and reduced social network size (Steptoe, Shankar et al. 2013, Courtin and Knapp 2017).
* **Loneliness** is often defined as the subjective evaluation of social relationships which reflects the individualâ€™s dissatisfaction with the frequency and closeness of their social contacts (Steptoe, Shankar et al. 2013, Courtin and Knapp 2017).
* Socially connected individuals can feel lonely, just as socially isolated individuals can be satisfied with their social relationships (Rico-Uribe, Caballero et al. 2016).
* Given weak correlations among them, isolation and loneliness may influence health through different pathways (Holt-Lunstad, Robles et al. 2017).
* Analyzing both objective and subjective aspects of social relationships simultaneously can allow us to better understand how different dimensions of social relationships affect health.
